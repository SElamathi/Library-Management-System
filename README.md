# 📚 Library Management System
The Library Management System is a Python-based application developed to simplify and automate the day-to-day operations of a library. The system helps manage books, members, and borrowing activities efficiently while reducing manual work and maintaining accurate digital records.

This project provides separate login systems for Admin and Members, ensuring secure access and proper role-based functionality. The Admin can manage the library database by adding, updating, deleting, and searching book records, while Members can view available books and request to borrow or return them.

The application is built using Python’s Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and MySQL as the backend database. Real-time database connectivity is achieved using mysql-connector-python, enabling smooth interaction between the GUI and the database.

A structured borrowing system is implemented where each member is allowed to borrow a maximum of five books at a time. All borrowing requests require admin approval, ensuring controlled and organized book distribution. The system maintains proper records of issued and returned books, improving transparency and accountability.

The Library Management System features a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy to use for librarians as well as members with minimal technical knowledge. The project is scalable and can be enhanced further to support advanced features.
